Solution: Splitting a number n as a sum of two numbers will have a property that after its half, the values a and b
get swapped. e.g.
7 = 1 + 6
7 = 2 + 5
7 = 3 + 4
After that
7 = 4 + 3
7 = 5 + 2
7 = 6 + 1
Therefore, we only need to consider on set of those sums which means we would have (n-1)/2 combinations. The n-1 takes
care of avoiding the equality case when n is even, since the sisters cannot have equal number of candies.
