# The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

#Add logic to print two lines.
#The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b.
#The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.


a = int(input())
b = int(input())

# Integer division
print(a//b)
# Float division
print(a/b)
